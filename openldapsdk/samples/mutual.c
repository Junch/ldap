    mutual.c
***************************************************************************
   Description: Demonstrates mutual authentication with an LDAP server via
   SSL. Three files are used in this sample to mutually authenticate with 
   an LDAP server. They are:
   
   1. server trusted root certificate
   2. client public key certificate
   3. client private key
   
   The server trusted root and client public key certificate files are used
   to authenticate the server and client respectively. The ldapssl api uses
   the server trusted root certificate to validate the server it is trying to
   connect to. The client public key certificate is sent to the server to
   authenticate the client and it contains the clients public key information.
   The client private key contains the key used by the ldapssl api to encrypt
   data to send the server. The server un-encrypts data from the
   client via the client's public key.
   
   The client public key certificate file may contain the clients private key
   if created properly. This file can be used as the client private key and 
   public key certificate file (The private key information is never sent to
   the server).

   In order to run this sample some configuring needs to be done on the LDAP
   server that you are testing against. The following are steps needed to
   configure an eDirectory LDAP server to do mutual authentication. It is
   assumed that you are using ConsoleOne with admin rights to configure
   eDirectory. eDirectory 8.7 or newer is required. 
   
   1. To ensure that the client certificate is being sent to the server,
      require client certificates for the LDAP Server. This is done by setting 
      "Client Certificate:" to "Required" in the "LDAP Server" under the
      "TLS Configuration" tab in ConsoleOne.
      (LDAP Server|TLS Configuration|Client Certificate:|Required)
      
   2. Export the SSL CertificateDNS object trusted root certificate.
      (This is your server trusted root certificate file.) For this example
      name it "server.der"
      (SSL CertificateDNS|Certificates|Trusted Root Certificate|Export)
      
   3. Create a client in ConsoleOne. Lets call the client "dave"
      with a password of "foo" in the organization "Acme".
      (File|New|User...)
      
   4. Create a certificate for "dave".
      (dave|Security|Certificate|Create)
      
   5. Refresh the NLDAP server now.
      (LDAP Server|General|Refresh NLDAP Server Now)
      
   6. Authenticate into ConsoleOne as "dave".(This allows you to export "dave"
      certificate that contains both private and public keys.)
      (File|Authenticate)
      
   7. Export dave's certificate with the private key. (This certificate 
      can be used for both the client certificate and private key file.)
      For this example name the certificate file "dave.pfx" with a password
      of "evad".
      (dave|Security|Certificate|Export|Yes export the private key)
   
   At this point you should be able to run this sample as follows. For this
   example assume the server name is "Acme.com" and "dave" was created in
   an organization called "Acme"
   
   mutual Acme.com 636 cn=dave,o=Acme foo
    server.der DER 
    dave.pfx PFX evad
    dave.pfx PFX evad
